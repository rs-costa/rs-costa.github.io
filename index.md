### Research Interests
#**Computational Solutions to guide Biotechnology and Clinical Medicine**#

In [Metabolic Engineering](https://www.nature.com/subjects/metabolic-engineering), the task of identifying the key modifications that will lead to microbial strains with high yield/titer for 
industrial production (e.g., to substitute petroleum-derived by bio-based compounds) is a quite challenge one, requiring robust computational approaches. Similarly to the biotech industry, 
the computational modeling of complex diseases and for healthcare applications in a proactive/preventive patient-oriented context is also a hot
topic of research.

The main topic of my PhD was in metabolic modeling of biological systems and I am still working on this theme. Since my 
PhD, I have been interested on the development and application of computational approaches, algorithms, models, and databases
to [Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.org/about/what-is-systems-biology/), particularly for system level analysis of microbial metabolism. Towards this end, I employ different
modeling approaches including, ODE-based modeling, constraint-based modeling and hybrid approaches in close collaboration 
with experimental groups. I also belong to a [consortium of researchers](http://www.bit.ly/1OsnTZr) interested in whole-cell 
modelling using openly available softwares and standards. Finally, I am currently involving on the regular maintenance of 
[*Ki*MoSys](https://www.kimosys.org), a web-based data repository for quantitative kinetic models. More recently, I  diversified my research
activities and developed an interest in the [Systems Medicine](https://easym.eu/about-easym/what-is-systems-medicine/) field, with emphasis in systems engineering techniques (such as machine learning algorithms and medical [decision support systems](http://vimeo.com/241154708)) for (bio-)clinical data analysis.

**Key-terms of research:** Systems Biology modeling, constraint-based and kinetic metabolic modeling, optimization, metabolism, industrial biotechnology; Systems Clinical Medicine, healthcare informatics, Data Science, data-driven approaches, data management, clinical risk prediction
