### Research Interests
In Metabolic Engineering, the task of identifying the modifications that will lead to microbial strains with high yields for 
industrial production is a quite challenge one, requiring robust modelling approaches. Similarly to the biotech industry, 
the computational modeling and prediction of complex diseases in a proactive/preventive patient-oriented context is also a hot
topic of research.

The the main topic of my PhD was in metabolic modeling of biological systems and I am still working on this theme. Since my 
PhD, I have been interested on the development and application of computational approaches, algorithms, models, and databases
to Systems Biology, particularly for system level analysis of bacterial metabolism. Towards this end, I employ different
modeling approaches including, ODE-based modeling, constraint-based modeling and hybrid approaches in close collaboration 
with experimental groups. I also belong to a [consortium of researchers](http://www.bit.ly/1OsnTZr) interested in whole-cell 
modelling using openly available softwares and standards. Finally, I am currently involving on the regular maintenance of 
[*Ki*MoSys](https://www.kimosys.org), a web-based database for kinetic models. More recently, I  diversified my research
activities and developed an interest in the Systems Bio-medicine field, with emphasis in systems engineering techniques 
(e.g. machine learning algorithms) for (bio-)clinical data analysis. Within this topic, I established a national collaboration 
with the Public Administration sector (IPO-Porto hospital).

**Key-terms:** Systems Biology modeling; constraint-based and kinetic metabolic modeling; optimization; metabolism; computational Systems Biomedicine; Data Science; systems engineering; data-driven approaches; surgical risk prediction.
