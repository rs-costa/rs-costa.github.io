**Short Bio:** Rafael Costa is currently an Assistant Researcher at FCT-NOVA and a collaborator at Center of Intelligent Systems, IST-UL. He is also an invited assistant professor. His research focuses on systems biology modeling and data science with application in biotechnology and medicine.

### Research Interests

The main topic of my PhD was in metabolic modeling, control and optimization of biological systems and I am still working on this theme. Since my 
PhD, I have been interested on the development and application of computational approaches, algorithms, models, and databases
to [Systems Biology](https://systemsbiology.org/about/what-is-systems-biology/), particularly for system level analysis of microbial metabolism. Towards this end, I employ different
modeling approaches including, ODE-based modeling, constraint-based modeling and hybrid approaches in close collaboration 
with experimental groups. I also belong to a [consortium of researchers](http://www.bit.ly/1OsnTZr) interested in whole-cell 
modelling using openly available softwares and standards. Finally, I am currently involving on the regular maintenance of 
[*Ki*MoSys](https://www.kimosys.org), a web-based data repository for quantitative kinetic models. More recently, I  diversified my research
activities and developed an interest in the [Systems Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/emm2017290) field, with emphasis in systems engineering techniques (such as machine learning algorithms, statistical methods and [decision support systems](http://vimeo.com/241154708)) for (bio-)clinical data analysis.

**Key-terms of research:** Systems Biology modeling, optimization, industrial biotechnology, systems clinical medicine, healthcare informatics, data science, data-driven approaches, data management, clinical risk prediction, bioinformatics
